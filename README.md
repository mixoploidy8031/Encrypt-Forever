# Poof Gone

## Purpose

This repository contains a demonstration script showcasing basic file encryption and secure deletion techniques. The code is intended for **educational purposes only** and to help developers understand fundamental concepts of cryptography and secure file handling.

## Warnings

### 1. **Not for Malicious Use**

This script must not be used for any malicious purposes, such as ransomware development, unauthorized data manipulation, or unethical activities. Misusing this code may result in severe legal consequences.

### 2. **Dummy BTC Address**

The Bitcoin address in the code is a placeholder and is not intended for any real transactions. Do not attempt to use this address to solicit payments or conduct any monetary activities.

### 3. **Sensitive Operations**

The script includes secure file deletion and encryption functionalities. Exercise caution when using these features, as they may result in permanent data loss if used improperly. Be ESPECIALLY careful with main_v2 (will encrypt all files in all directories - it is HIGHLY suggested to use a virtual machine when testing anything from this repository). 

### 4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

Ensure you have the proper permissions to encrypt or modify any files before running this script. Unauthorized encryption of files may violate laws or terms of service. 

### 5. **No Warranty**

This script is provided "as is" without any warranty. I am not responsible for damages resulting from the use or misuse of this code.

## Features

- AES encryption using a randomly generated key and IV
- Secure deletion of original files after encryption
- Creation of placeholder files for demonstration purposes

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script in a controlled environment (e.g., a test directory with non-critical files).
3. Understand each function before execution to prevent unintended consequences.

## Ethical Use Statement

This script is a tool for learning and exploration in cryptography and secure file operations. By using this code, you agree to abide by all applicable laws and ethical guidelines.
